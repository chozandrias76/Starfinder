# Emails
## 06-06-2018 - Session 1
>Thanks again for joining yesterday for a very exciting start to our Starfinder campaign. I'm surprised how much you guys got into roleplaying on the first time around and it was really great to hear more about your characters, and as Brian mentioned, how they fit into the "cast". I believe that these are our current cast of characters:

* RT: Special FX
* Crom: Pilot (Jack of all trades)
* Arietta: Diva
* Vezik: Pilot (Jack of all trades)
* Rovni: Bodyguard
* Marv: Producer

>Please let me know if I am wrong on these roles.

>Under contract from ESPN 8 the Ocho, you arrived to Cetra Station on your trusty shuttle, "The Nielsen V". Your arrival was not met with the usual pomp and circumstance that you have come to expect, but instead some mixed feelings from the station crew. Some of the crew and visitors greeted you warmly, others expressed their distaste of the frequent visits of musicians to their otherwise calm station.

>As you continued to explore you "stumbled" upon some unusual items by distracting some guards and "picking" some locks.
         
>Upon reading the data core in more detail and observing other notes in the ship, you learned that the station has been receiving a new musical act at least once a week, and a very distinguished diva ( Nessa) had been here this very week! As Arietta and others noted, there was just something odd about her act. She seemed to enchant her spectators with her music, her lights, and her other effects. 

>As you continued to explore the source of her motives, you explored the rest of the corridors, turning locks on secure airlocks and opening rooms using her personal password. As you continued to push further, you intimidated a guard into submission, and barged into Nessa's personal quarters where she had two guards posted. You were then met by their immediate hostility!

## 06-06-2018 - Session 2
>As you all followed your suspicions from the previous session, you learned that Nessa wasn't the stereotypical arch rival you expected. She in fact had been worried about the missing Divas as much as you have been, and was very willing to part with some information despite the death you caused to her friends.  

>Through the investigation of Nessa's control crystals and her stage setup, you found that something out of the normal was definately causing her spectators to become so enchanted by her act. Some advanced technology was clearly at work and after examining her lighting setup, you found this to be the root cause of her influence. Fortunately RT was also able to reverse engineer one of the lights into a hand held device. Among the custom light rig, your team also acquired:

>In the early morning on the following day, you were all startled to your feet by the sounds and reverberations of the station blowing up around you. As you opened your door, the sound of klaxons filled your ears and panic was all around you. You followed behind a group of guards that were en route to the action, and their path lead you straight to Nessa's quarters. While ducking your head behind narrow corridors, your team noticed that it wasn't Nessa wreaking havoc, but some other unknown group of baddies.

>You overheard the dialogue between Nessa and the leader of these baddies--learning that Nessa had some information that they didn't want to get out, and that they planned to nuke the whole station to stop her. Unfortunately for them, your rush to her aid gave her and yourself the needed time to escape. As Marv bolted down corridors away from the rest of the crew, he found a couple able bodies to help him fly your ship. Former store owners on Cetra station, Willian and Jani were more than happy to lend a hand with the ship operations in exchange for Marv helping them escape. 

>As the team split into two vessels, everyone seemed to escape the station just before meeting absolute devastation. Before everyone was even a minute from the station however, an unknown vessel approached the two ships in a hot pursuit.
## 06-20-2018 - Session 3
>At the beginning of the session, you guys were being chased down by an unknown vessel hellbent on stopping you from leaving the station. Fortunately, with the combined efforts of your two ships, you were able to destroy their ship and escape the vicinity.

>From Marv's knowledge about the network, he knew the best place to get in contact with them would be Absalom Station; and this would be the best way to figure out what the hell was going on with the missing Divas. Although Absalom Station stirs up some rough memories for some of the crew, it still is the central hub of culture and commerce in the area, and the best spot to recover after a rough journey. As Nessa mentioned, you both also had a mutual contact to the network in the form of Darron Volante and he would be the best person to reach for some answers. 

>En route on your 4 day journey from Cetra Station to Absalom, a tragic event played out on the Nielson V! Just as the crew were sinking back into their chairs after narrowly escaping their own death, the clutches of a stowaway Reptoid shapeshifter wrapped around Crom's neck. Marv tried to talk down the situation but unfortunately, the Reptoid's contract was secure and nothing would get her to back down. After succesfully disarming her, Marv moved to further deescalate the situation, digging into her motives when she decided to seal her deal by digging her hands into Crom's chest -- killing him instantly! Turning a loss into an opportunity, Marv introduced himself to Tsarra, and after recognizing her greater potential as a shape-changer, he decided to take her onto the crew. Though this transition was a bit of a surprise to some, it was taken more easily by others who saw Crom as somewhat of a loose cannon. What this new member will bring to the team, nobody fully knows, but what is certian is that the group can use all the help it can get.

>Upon arriving to Fardock in Absolom, the group got some much needed food and rejuvenation before moving to "The Eye" (the cultural center), where Marv gave Darron a ring, and scheduled a informal meeting. As a casual confrontation lead to more aggressive interrogation, Marv learned that Darron did not know anything about the conspiracy that your team had been investigating. Clearly intimidated by Marv, Darron decided he would try to set you up with a conversation with his boss at the Network; a person neither Darron or yourself had ever met. Unfortunately, Darron needed a full day to set up meeting with his boss, giving the group some time to rest and explore the rest of Absalom Station.

>As the group wandered around the enormous station, everyone was enveloped in the sights, smells and sounds of the busiest hub in the solar system. You all decided to eventually make you way over to the Click-Clack Club, a hotspot for all Androids and artificial lifeforms. After a few moments of casual conversations with the local riff-raff, you noticed RT in the bar and were introduced to Flux-3, who was clearly looking for an answer in the bottom of their glass. With Marv recognizing his new position as an admiral and Flux-3 realizing they had nothing to lose, they decided to strike a mutually beneficial contract for Flux-3 to join the crew. Although Flux doesn't find themselves providing much in the realm of a reality TV show, they claim to be a very skilled mechanic, and if the past events are any indication, the crew shortly realized the value Flux could provide in keeping their duct-taped armada together. 

>The entire crew was visibly effected by all of the events leading up to now; with Vezik having his first brush with death, and Arietta saddened by the death of his stunt double Crom. Most of you have heard of Absalom, but not necessarily have traveled here in person before and are surprised by the enormity of this station. Although most of you are out of your element here, you are all united in the same cause: getting to the bottom of the reason for these missing divas. Nothing will stop you all from keeping Arietta safe and you will continue to seek out new and exciting adventures to create the most spectacular reality show.
