# Emails
## 06-06-2018 - Session 1.
>Thanks again for joining yesterday for a very exciting start to our Starfinder campaign. I'm surprised how much you guys got into roleplaying on the first time around and it was really great to hear more about your characters, and as Brian mentioned, how they fit into the "cast". I believe that these are our current cast of characters:

* RT: Special FX
* Crom: Pilot (Jack of all trades)
* Arietta: Diva
* Vezik: Pilot (Jack of all trades)
* Rovni: Bodyguard
* Marv: Producer

>Please let me know if I am wrong on these roles.

>Under contract from ESPN 8 the Ocho, you arrived to Cetra Station on your trusty shuttle, "The Nielsen V". Your arrival was not met with the usual pomp and circumstance that you have come to expect, but instead some mixed feelings from the station crew. Some of the crew and visitors greeted you warmly, others expressed their distaste of the frequent visits of musicians to their otherwise calm station.

>As you continued to explore you "stumbled" upon some unusual items by distracting some guards and "picking" some locks. Inside you received the following items

>Upon reading the data core in more detail and observing other notes in the ship, you learned that the station has been receiving a new musical act at least once a week, and a very distinguished diva ( Nessa) had been here this very week! As Arietta and others noted, there was just something odd about her act. She seemed to enchant her spectators with her music, her lights, and her other effects. 

>As you continued to explore the source of her motives, you explored the rest of the corridors, turning locks on secure airlocks and opening rooms using her personal password. As you continued to push further, you intimidated a guard into submission, and barged into Nessa's personal quarters where she had two guards posted. You were then met by their immediate hostility!

## 06-06-2018 - Session 2.
>As you all followed your suspicions from the previous session, you learned that Nessa wasn't the stereotypical arch rival you expected. She in fact had been worried about the missing Divas as much as you have been, and was very willing to part with some information despite the death you caused to her friends.  

>Through the investigation of Nessa's control crystals and her stage setup, you found that something out of the normal was definately causing her spectators to become so enchanted by her act. Some advanced technology was clearly at work and after examining her lighting setup, you found this to be the root cause of her influence. Fortunately RT was also able to reverse engineer one of the lights into a hand held device. Among the custom light rig, your team also acquired:

>In the early morning on the following day, you were all startled to your feet by the sounds and reverberations of the station blowing up around you. As you opened your door, the sound of klaxons filled your ears and panic was all around you. You followed behind a group of guards that were en route to the action, and their path lead you straight to Nessa's quarters. While ducking your head behind narrow corridors, your team noticed that it wasn't Nessa wreaking havoc, but some other unknown group of baddies.

>You overheard the dialogue between Nessa and the leader of these baddies--learning that Nessa had some information that they didn't want to get out, and that they planned to nuke the whole station to stop her. Unfortunately for them, your rush to her aid gave her and yourself the needed time to escape. As Marv bolted down corridors away from the rest of the crew, he found a couple able bodies to help him fly your ship. Former store owners on Cetra station, Willian and Jani were more than happy to lend a hand with the ship operations in exchange for Marv helping them escape. 

>As the team split into two vessels, everyone seemed to escape the station just before meeting absolute devastation. Before everyone was even a minute from the station however, an unknown vessel approached the two ships in a hot pursuit.
