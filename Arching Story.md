SPECIAL ABILITIES
<ul>
<li>Flame Blast (Su) A flamewraith’s flame blast has a range of 60
feet (no increment).</li>
<li>Ghost Flames (Su) A flamewraith is constantly surrounded by a
nimbus of flickering, ghostly flames that deal 1d4 fire damage to
adjacent creatures (Reflex DC 12 half ). If a flamewraith takes any
amount of cold damage, this aura is suppressed for 1 round.</li>
<li>Inferno (Su) As a full action, a flamewraith can expand and
intensify its ghost flames aura. The flames blaze outward,
dealing 1d6 fire damage to creatures in a 10-foot-radius
burst centered on the flamewraith (Reflex DC 12 half ). It can’t
activate this ability again for 1d4 rounds, during which its
ghost flames aura is suppressed.</li>
<li>Undead Immunities (Ex) Undead have immunity to the
following effects, unless the effect specifies that it works
against undead: ability damage, ability drain, bleed, death
effects, disease, energy drain, exhaustion, fatigue, mindaffecting
effects, negative levels, nonlethal damage, paralysis,
poison, sleep, and stunning. An undead is immune to any
effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect works
on objects.</li>
<li>Unliving (Ex) A construct or undead has no Constitution
modifier and is immediately destroyed when it reaches 0 Hit
Points. An unliving creature doesn’t recover from damage
naturally, but a construct can be repaired with the right tools.
Spells like make whole can heal constructs, and negative
energy can heal undead. An unliving creature with fast
healing benefits from that ability. Unliving creatures don’t
breathe, eat, or sleep. They can’t be raised or resurrected.</li>
</ul>

Heads up! if there are any required stat block changes below this warning, they will need to be added manually.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Gaze (Su) Opponents that look at a creature with a gaze ability are in danger of being charmed, being paralyzed, being turned to stone, or suffering another negative effect. Each opponent within the gaze's listed range must attempt a saving throw (usually Fortitude or Will) at the beginning of its turn. On a successful save, the effect is negated. An opponent can give itself an advantage against this ability in one of two ways. Looking Obliquely: An opponent that avoids looking directly at the creature's face (either by following the creature's shadow or by tracking it in a reflective surface) or that looks at the creature through a camera or heads-up display gains a +4 circumstance bonus to the saving throw. However, the creature with the gaze ability gains concealment against that opponent. Blocking Its Vision: By completely blocking or covering its own visual sensors, an opponent doesn't need to attempt a save against the gaze. However, the creature with the gaze ability gains total concealment against that opponent. Gaze abilities can affect ethereal opponents but not opponents without visual sensors. A creature is immune to the gaze abilities of others of its kind unless otherwise noted. Allies of a creature with a gaze ability can still be affected, but they are always considered to be looking obliquely at the creature. The creature can also veil its eyes, thus negating its gaze ability.

<h3>JUMP JETS</h3>
CAPACITY 20 USAGE 2/action
You can activate jump jets as part of a move action in order to fly during your movement. You can fly up to 30 feet (average
maneuverability) with a maximum height of 10 feet, or you can
fly up to 20 feet straight up. You must land at the end of your
move action. Jump jets can’t lift you if you’re encumbered.
This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.

Weapon: Add a ranged weapon of a level no greater than the creature’s CR + 1; this weapon can’t be disarmed. A creature with the combatant array should get a longarm, and a creature with the expert or spellcaster array should get a small arm. Add the creature’s CR to damage dealt with its weapon. The ammunition of such weapons is recovered once per day after the creature rests for 8 hours.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Energy Drain (Su) A successful energy drain attack inflicts one or more negative levels (as described in the ability). If an attack that includes an energy drain scores a critical hit, it inflicts twice the listed number of negative levels. Unless otherwise specified in the draining creature's description, it gains 5 temporary Hit Points for each negative level it inflicts on an opponent. These temporary Hit Points last for a maximum of 1 hour. Negative levels from energy drain remain until 24 hours have passed or until they are removed with magic or technology. If a negative level isn't removed before 24 hours have passed, the affected target must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (the exact DC is given in the creature's stat block). On a success, the negative level goes away. On a failure, the negative level becomes permanent. A separate saving throw is required for each negative level.

### Marv's details
>Used to run with the gambling crowd
he made some friends, some enemies
mostly just lost money
He knows a guy though

>Ch'tago, just Tago for short. He's a kasathas who runs a bookie that takes bets on all sorts of illicit activities. It's nestled deep in the Absalom underground.

>In exchange Marv got a small cut of the profits, free drinks, and a place to hang out.

>Tago ran into trouble with Absalom Station authorities shortly after arriving on station (He was exiled from his homeworld). After getting caught selling moody goods in an alley he made a run for it got hit by a transport platform. He was arrested and lost one of his four arms in the accident.
But that was 50 years ago
He's much older and wiser now.

Tago has been in contact with their old mutual friend Ancrish. Ancrish is doing very well for himself as the owner of a casino on a remote planet. 

Tago says that Ancrish has been feeling a bit down and unsafe as of late. He asked Tago if he would stop by to see him for advise. Tago asks Marv to go pay him a visit since he already has a ship and knows Ancrish a little better.

Given that Marv agrees, the team sets off to a Legandary World known as Voltrez

<pre>Travel to Near Space (3d6 Days): Near Space contains the
Pact Worlds system and most of the worlds colonized
and contacted so far by their explorers, but there are still
thousands of Near Space worlds yet to be investigated.
Jumps to Near Space worlds rarely carry more than a 10%
chance of a random encounter while in the Drift.
D Travel to the Vast (5d6 Days): Largely unexplored,</pre>

### Hook #3: Legendary Worlds - Volretz

>The owner of the Icebox Casino, Ancrish Illton,
narrowly avoided an attempted murder. His security team
took down the would-be assassin, who left no clues as to who
she worked for or why someone wants Ancrish dead. However,
the high-end poison used by the killer has the normally
relaxed casino mogul convinced that this will not be the last
attempt. 

>He hires the PCs to investigate. In his position, he
has made a few enemies, and the PCs easily discover a number
of leads as their investigation leads them all over the city. A
successful Diplomacy check to gather information at each
of the following locations provides one rumor. Choose or
randomly select one option to be the correct one.


> * Icebox Casino: Wealthy tourists come to visit the Icebox from
many different planets, and some of them are both powerful
and dangerous. Did the wrong gambler lose a fortune at the
tables and decide to take out the owner responsible?
The PCs, during the course of their investigations, get
attacked by a small team of assassins. If they can not only
fend off the attack, but take one hired killer alive, they can
learn who hired the hit on Ancrish.

> * Inn: Many returning miners immediately gambled and
lost their paychecks at the Icebox, forcing many to take on
more difficult assignments. Could there be a coalition out to
take revenge for predatory gambling?

> * Morkance Mining Company Foundry: Nothing happens
in Morkansia without Kayriga Sarkit knowing about it.
Has the Morkance Mining Company decided that the only
moneymaker on Volretz that doesn’t return value to the
Company needs to go, perhaps to be replaced with another
Morkance business?

> * City Administrative Buildings: The employees at the city
buildings have heard that Ancrish had an affair with the
vice-mayor Waltsyn Cargette, opening up the possibility of a
crime of passion. Did Waltsyn convince Hrent Cibtullon that
Ancrish poses a threat to the safety of the city?


>If the team investigates, they will find out that there was an arms dealer 
trying to launder the money through the casino. Ancrish is actually involved
in this deal, but he didn't initially reveal these details to the group.

>The group can learn of the Arms dealer's location on Voltrez. The journey will require some heavy gear as most of the planet is inhospitable.

>Upon combat or diplomacy success, the crew learns that the arms dealer is Android specializing on a new rare technology for implantation. 
### OPTIONAL
>The Arms dealer has products that match the diva data cores if they investigate that during their long journey.

Heads up! if there are any required stat block changes below this warning, they will need to be added manually.

> __Text Armor__: If the creature is CR 3–7, add one armor upgrade with an item level equal to or less than the creature’s CR. If it is CR 8+, add two armor upgrades, each with an item level equal to or less than the creature’s CR.
Weapon: Add a ranged weapon of a level no greater than the creature’s CR + 1; this weapon can’t be disarmed. A creature with the combatant array should get a longarm, and a creature with the expert or spellcaster array should get a small arm. Add the creature’s CR to damage dealt with its weapon. The ammunition of such weapons is recovered once per day after the creature rests for 8 hours.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES
>__Change Shape__ (Su) The creature has the ability to assume the appearance of a specific creature or type of creature, but it retains most of its own physical qualities. If the form assumed has any of the following abilities, the creature gains them while in that form: blindsight (scent), darkvision, low-light vision, and swim 30 feet. The creature can retain its own breathing ability, or it can assume the ability to breathe in any environment the assumed shape can breathe in (including the no breath ability, which enables it to survive in the vacuum of space). If the ability does not specify what the creature can change shape into, it can assume the form of any creature of the humanoid type, but it can't mimic a specific humanoid. Change shape grants a +10 bonus to Disguise checks to appear as a creature of the type and subtype of the new form, and the DC of the creature's Disguise check is not modified as a result of altering major features or disguising itself as a different race or creature type. A creature can assume a form that is one size category smaller or larger than its original form; it becomes that size. Unless otherwise stated, it can remain in an alternate form indefinitely. Some creatures can transform into unique forms with special modifiers and abilities. These creatures adjust their ability scores, as noted in their description.

## 06-06-2018 - Session 1
>Thanks again for joining yesterday for a very exciting start to our Starfinder campaign. I'm surprised how much you guys got into roleplaying on the first time around and it was really great to hear more about your characters, and as Brian mentioned, how they fit into the "cast". I believe that these are our current cast of characters:

* RT: Special FX
* Crom: Pilot (Jack of all trades)
* Arietta: Diva
* Vezik: Pilot (Jack of all trades)
* Rovni: Bodyguard
* Marv: Producer

>Please let me know if I am wrong on these roles.

>Under contract from ESPN 8 the Ocho, you arrived to Cetra Station on your trusty shuttle, "The Nielsen V". Your arrival was not met with the usual pomp and circumstance that you have come to expect, but instead some mixed feelings from the station crew. Some of the crew and visitors greeted you warmly, others expressed their distaste of the frequent visits of musicians to their otherwise calm station.

>As you continued to explore you "stumbled" upon some unusual items by distracting some guards and "picking" some locks.
         
>Upon reading the data core in more detail and observing other notes in the ship, you learned that the station has been receiving a new musical act at least once a week, and a very distinguished diva ( Nessa) had been here this very week! As Arietta and others noted, there was just something odd about her act. She seemed to enchant her spectators with her music, her lights, and her other effects. 

>As you continued to explore the source of her motives, you explored the rest of the corridors, turning locks on secure airlocks and opening rooms using her personal password. As you continued to push further, you intimidated a guard into submission, and barged into Nessa's personal quarters where she had two guards posted. You were then met by their immediate hostility!
***
## 06-06-2018 - Session 2
>As you all followed your suspicions from the previous session, you learned that Nessa wasn't the stereotypical arch rival you expected. She in fact had been worried about the missing Divas as much as you have been, and was very willing to part with some information despite the death you caused to her friends.  

>Through the investigation of Nessa's control crystals and her stage setup, you found that something out of the normal was definately causing her spectators to become so enchanted by her act. Some advanced technology was clearly at work and after examining her lighting setup, you found this to be the root cause of her influence. Fortunately RT was also able to reverse engineer one of the lights into a hand held device. Among the custom light rig, your team also acquired:

>In the early morning on the following day, you were all startled to your feet by the sounds and reverberations of the station blowing up around you. As you opened your door, the sound of klaxons filled your ears and panic was all around you. You followed behind a group of guards that were en route to the action, and their path lead you straight to Nessa's quarters. While ducking your head behind narrow corridors, your team noticed that it wasn't Nessa wreaking havoc, but some other unknown group of baddies.

>You overheard the dialogue between Nessa and the leader of these baddies--learning that Nessa had some information that they didn't want to get out, and that they planned to nuke the whole station to stop her. Unfortunately for them, your rush to her aid gave her and yourself the needed time to escape. As Marv bolted down corridors away from the rest of the crew, he found a couple able bodies to help him fly your ship. Former store owners on Cetra station, Willian and Jani were more than happy to lend a hand with the ship operations in exchange for Marv helping them escape. 

>As the team split into two vessels, everyone seemed to escape the station just before meeting absolute devastation. Before everyone was even a minute from the station however, an unknown vessel approached the two ships in a hot pursuit.
***
## 06-20-2018 - Session 3
>At the beginning of the session, you guys were being chased down by an unknown vessel hellbent on stopping you from leaving the station. Fortunately, with the combined efforts of your two ships, you were able to destroy their ship and escape the vicinity.

>From Marv's knowledge about the network, he knew the best place to get in contact with them would be Absalom Station; and this would be the best way to figure out what the hell was going on with the missing Divas. Although Absalom Station stirs up some rough memories for some of the crew, it still is the central hub of culture and commerce in the area, and the best spot to recover after a rough journey. As Nessa mentioned, you both also had a mutual contact to the network in the form of Darron Volante and he would be the best person to reach for some answers. 

>En route on your 4 day journey from Cetra Station to Absalom, a tragic event played out on the Nielson V! Just as the crew were sinking back into their chairs after narrowly escaping their own death, the clutches of a stowaway Reptoid shapeshifter wrapped around Crom's neck. Marv tried to talk down the situation but unfortunately, the Reptoid's contract was secure and nothing would get her to back down. After succesfully disarming her, Marv moved to further deescalate the situation, digging into her motives when she decided to seal her deal by digging her hands into Crom's chest -- killing him instantly! Turning a loss into an opportunity, Marv introduced himself to Tsarra, and after recognizing her greater potential as a shape-changer, he decided to take her onto the crew. Though this transition was a bit of a surprise to some, it was taken more easily by others who saw Crom as somewhat of a loose cannon. What this new member will bring to the team, nobody fully knows, but what is certian is that the group can use all the help it can get.

>Upon arriving to Fardock in Absolom, the group got some much needed food and rejuvenation before moving to "The Eye" (the cultural center), where Marv gave Darron a ring, and scheduled a informal meeting. As a casual confrontation lead to more aggressive interrogation, Marv learned that Darron did not know anything about the conspiracy that your team had been investigating. Clearly intimidated by Marv, Darron decided he would try to set you up with a conversation with his boss at the Network; a person neither Darron or yourself had ever met. Unfortunately, Darron needed a full day to set up meeting with his boss, giving the group some time to rest and explore the rest of Absalom Station.

>As the group wandered around the enormous station, everyone was enveloped in the sights, smells and sounds of the busiest hub in the solar system. You all decided to eventually make you way over to the Click-Clack Club, a hotspot for all Androids and artificial lifeforms. After a few moments of casual conversations with the local riff-raff, you noticed RT in the bar and were introduced to Flux-3, who was clearly looking for an answer in the bottom of their glass. With Marv recognizing his new position as an admiral and Flux-3 realizing they had nothing to lose, they decided to strike a mutually beneficial contract for Flux-3 to join the crew. Although Flux doesn't find themselves providing much in the realm of a reality TV show, they claim to be a very skilled mechanic, and if the past events are any indication, the crew shortly realized the value Flux could provide in keeping their duct-taped armada together. 

>The entire crew was visibly effected by all of the events leading up to now; with Vezik having his first brush with death, and Arietta saddened by the death of his stunt double Crom. Most of you have heard of Absalom, but not necessarily have traveled here in person before and are surprised by the enormity of this station. Although most of you are out of your element here, you are all united in the same cause: getting to the bottom of the reason for these missing divas. Nothing will stop you all from keeping Arietta safe and you will continue to seek out new and exciting adventures to create the most spectacular reality show.
***
## 07-27-2018 - Session 4
>Hey All,

>Last time on Starfinder: The Entertainers (Chapter 1), your adventure was full of intrigue and investigation! 

>As the group left the Click Clack Club for some much needed rest, a nervous scientist (Gastion Cayne) inattentively bumped into Vezik. Quckly realizing that Vezik was the son of his former colleges, he let down his guard and revealed to the group his quandary: that his co-worker and friend (Nadia Raschke) had gone missing and he didn't know what to do!

>Gastion spoke of a exclusive contract his company offered to himself and Nadia--both feeling that it seemed too fishy, they declined. Many of his coworkers feeling the same way also turned down the contract and shortly thereafter, Nadia had gone missing. Upon doing his own research, Gastion learned there was some connection to Divas in the contract and he had also heard some rumors about some connection to the tragedy at Cetra Station. With nowhere else to turn, Gastion implored you to help discover what happened to Nadia setting you up with his connection at the Eyes Wide Agency (Evelynn Desai) who was already on the case. 

>After waiting in a long queue at the Eyes Wide Agency, you were finally introduced to Evelynn who had really only begun her investigation. She had some basic security footage of Nadia's room at the time, but was already headed that way for further examination. As you were all tied up in the case of missing Diva's and intrigued on what kind of connection Nadia's disappearance might have, you all decided to tag along. 

>During your initial examination, there was not much out of place. Clearly the door had been hacked and the files on her computer had been tampered with, but outside of that, there was no real struggle. Frustrated by the lack of evidence, the group dug deeper and found a residual radiation trace on the wall -- one in fact that matched the pattern of the influence lamp RT had crafted! Clearly there was a real connection to the Diva's disappearance now, and as you were all thirsty for more clear answers. Evelynn decided to run her security footage of that night against the facial recognition database and only found one match to a man who at that time was lounging at King Curney’s Kasbah.

>After confronting the man, you were able to convince him to reveal more information about the kidnapping job dispite his reservations. He revealed that Nadia was being held by a biotech company, and as you continued to follow through with Gastion's wishes, you infiltrated the facility past their meager security measures. 

>Upon entering the building on floor 20A, many of you were surprised by the inaction of local scientists who might have been opposed to your entrance. Marv began exploring the sterile corridors, being careful to open too many doors, but upon reaching the southern antichamber you found many of the rooms to have opaque doors and walls, requiring you to enter to get more information. 

>Inside these rooms you found a couple stasis pods with names on them of Divas you had known to go missing. Unfortunately you only found husks inside and after hacking their local terminals RT discovered that some medical experiments were connected. 

>Before you could continue to explore the remaining facility, Marv became trapped in one of the coonecting rooms as one of the local technicians conducted an experiment with no regard for Marv's life. As the group wrestled the tech for control of his computer, you realized something was quite disturbing about his reactions to everything around him. You were able to stop the test eventually and free Marv with no harm to your party. 

>What other disturbing questions are going to remained unanswered? You'll have to tune in next session to find out! 

>Last session you guys earned 200EXP each and 275 credits each.
***
## 08-17-2018 - Session 5
>I loved the direction the group ended up going when confronted with the new details on your investigation into the missing divas. You ended up going a route I didn't anticipate, but I am all for the transaction you agreed upon with  Dalton Hames. I'm going to make the write up short and concise for last week so it is easy to pick out the important details:

* You found Nadia in the research facility, unharmed and clearly under some sort of mind control. She was adamant on staying and until you used the manipulation lamp on her, she was willing to die for her research.

* You escorted Nadia to safety, and tried to meet up with her boss, Wyatt Drayton, to figure out what the hell kind of contract she was assigned.

* You were unable to make contact with her boss and instead met up with Evlynn to discuss the details of Nadia's rescue.

* Evylnn hadn't come up with much new information, but she did get her hands on some encrypted video from Cetra Station that she hasn't been able to crack. She handed it off to Refracting Tangent for further study.

* The group agreed it was time to meet Dalton Hames and find out what he knows.

* After winding up a few more floors of the network HQ in Bluerise Tower, you met Dalton and were a little surprised to learn what he knew about the missing divas. Your evidence was confirmed as you found he had at least some participation in their disappearance.

* He was not going to let the group leave after finding out how much they knew, and was about to silence everyone permanently until Marv struck a deal.

* The group was awarded the following haul after completion of this chapter and successful negotiation with Dalton:

* In exchange for the gear, the network canceled your contract and made you agree not to speak of what the group had learned ever again.

* As you left the upper floor, some sort of alarm sounded, you heard some muffled screaming behind one of the restricted doors and the group made a B-line for the exit!

>You were also all awarded 600 EXP

***
## 08-31-2018 - Session 6
>Hey Team,

>Thanks again for joining us for the last session where we traveled to a distant legendary world! Here is a brief summary of the events since the last session.
* The group met with Marv's friend Tago, who was one of Marv's long time friends and former boss.
* Marv mentioned to Tago that he had been looking for work. Tago was in contact with their old mutual friend Ancrish who also knew when Marv when he was working with Tago. Ancrish is doing very well for himself as the owner of a casino on a remote planet. 
* Tago said that Ancrish has been feeling a bit down and unsafe as of late. He asked Tago if he would stop by to see him for advise. Tago asked Marv to go pay him a visit since he already has a ship and knows Ancrish a little better.
* The group stripped down the Neilson in favor of the roomier "Harbinger" and filled it to capacity in order to travel to Voltrez, where Ancrish has his casino.
* Upon arrival to Voltrez and eventually the Icebox Casino, the group met with Ancrish who revealed that he hired the team to help investigate his attempted murder.
* Ancrish mentioned that some sort of high end poison was used against him, and he suspects one of the other few store owners in town must have been the perpetrators.
* The locations investigated so far have been the Inn, The Morkance Mining Compay, and the City Admin buildings.
* Team investigated entire town posing as a documentary team in most places, but haven't found any clues as to why Ancrish was almost poisoned.
* You weren't awarded any EXP from last session, but you were given 2,000 credits in up front payment for your services (as negotiated by Marv).

>I'm thinking since most people aren't able to make it at 6:30, we just plan on meeting at 7:00 PM PST instead. Is anyone opposed to doing that?

***
## 09-7-2018 - Session 7
>Hey Team,

>Good job last week really diving into the environment of the town. You got a really good surface look at what to explore the prior week and during the last session, you continued to investigate the origin of Ancrish's attempted poisoning. Here are some of the finer details and speculations you all had:
* You thoroughly questioned Ancrish about the night in question, revealing details about who the assisn might be.
* You found signs that his room had been infiltrated/exfiltrated via his window and found trace poison around the room and casino. After further analysis, you found that the poison was clearly homemade and hard to trace, but contained ingredients that had a very short expiration date.
* After questioning the head chef of the casino, you found that the most likely culprit was one of his delivery staff -- particularly a new hire that has missed a couple of his shifts.
* En route to the inn for further questioning, you were ambushed by a set of assassins. Wielding blades of flame, this group ended up not being much of a match for your crew. After killing one, and subduing the other, you unmasked the remaining assassin to discover he was the man you had been searching for (Arlen).
* With some successful interrogation, you were able to reveal the identity of Arlen's boss; a person known as Ex Ignis.
* Looking for further information about the night that transpired, you eventually all made your way over to the Mining Company headquarters, hacked your way in through their security, and scanned through Kayriga Sarkit's personal computer as well as a off limits research lab.
* From your investigation through these two key rooms you discovered that some encrypted emails had been sent back and forth from the facility, and they had been conducting some kind of study involving tissue recovery rates from high heat burns.
* Before leaving the mining company, you planted a worm in the lab computer, took a tissue sample for further study. This worm has the ability to remotely monitor incoming emails and cover its' tracks.
>No EXP awarded until our next milestone still. You did however receive 1,500 credits to split among the group as spoils from your combat with the assassins.

See you next session!
